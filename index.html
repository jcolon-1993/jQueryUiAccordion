        <div>
          <p>First prize is your very own DJI Phantom -
            a small, all-in-one quadcopter designed for
            aerial photography enthusiasts.

        <h3>2nd Prize</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Second prize is the Arduino Robot - the
            first official Arduino on wheels! The
            robot has two processors, one on each of
            its two boards. The Motor Board controls
            the motors, and the Control Board reads
            sensors and decides how to operate. Each of
            the boards is a full Arduino board
            programmable using the Arduino IDE.</p>
        </div>
